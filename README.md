# Unity Libre Fracture

Unity Libre Fracture is a free and open source fracture system developed for Unity Engine.
It uses NVIDIA Blast wrapper for unity as base from [here](https://forum.unity.com/threads/nvidia-blast.472623) and for concave meshes uses VHACD (Volumetric Hierarchical Approximate Convex Decomposition) from [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/VHACD).
